id = "data-visualization"
description = "Data visualization is the process of using visual elements like charts, graphs, or maps to represent data. It translates complex, high-volume, or numerical data into a visual representation that is easier to process. Data visualization tools improve and automate the visual communication process for accuracy and detail."
